# Artoo D2 Python SDK – Commercial EULA (Plain-English)

Last updated: 2025-09-09

This End-User License Agreement (EULA) applies to commercial subscriptions for Artoo’s D2 Python SDK. It sits alongside the source license and describes support/SLA, refunds, and liability. It does not replace or change the source license.

## 1) Relationship to the Source License
- The code is released under the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1) until the Change Date (2029-09-08).
- On the Change Date, the code for that version transitions to the Change License (LGPL-3.0-or-later).
- This EULA does not alter the BSL terms. If there’s any conflict, the BSL governs your rights to the code.

## 2) What your commercial subscription includes
- Access to the D2 Python SDK binaries/updates during the subscription term
- Priority support via email or ticketing (business days, reasonable efforts)
- Best-effort guidance on integration and configuration
- If your plan includes an SLA, it will be stated in your order (response time targets, support hours, and escalation paths)

## 3) Refunds / cancellations
- If you are not satisfied within the first 5 days of a new monthly subscription, contact us and we will work to make it right. Where permitted by law, we may offer a pro-rated refund at our discretion.
- Monthly subscriptions can be cancelled at the next billing cycle. Fees already paid are generally non-refundable unless required by law.

## 4) Managed service reminder
- The BSL prohibits offering the Licensed Work (or a service whose primary value is the Licensed Work’s functionality) as a hosted or managed service that competes with Artoo’s control-plane without a commercial agreement. This EULA does not waive that restriction.

## 5) No warranties
- The SDK and any support are provided “as is”. To the fullest extent allowed by law, Artoo disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 6) Limitation of liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, Artoo will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or for lost profits, revenue, data, or business interruption, even if advised of the possibility.
- Artoo’s aggregate liability arising out of this EULA will not exceed the amounts you paid to Artoo for the SDK in the 12 months prior to the claim.

## 7) Term and termination
- This EULA remains in effect while your subscription is active. We may terminate for material breach if not cured within 30 days of notice.
- Upon termination or non-renewal, you must stop using subscription-only services and updates. Your rights under the BSL for code received under that license remain as granted by the BSL.

## 8) General
- Governing law and venue may be specified in your order; if not, the laws of the State of California (USA), excluding conflict-of-laws rules, apply. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.
- This EULA, together with your order, is the entire agreement regarding the subject matter. If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder stays in effect.
- Updates to this EULA may occur from time to time; material changes will apply moving forward and not retroactively to already-delivered code under BSL.

If you have questions about commercial terms, support, or SLAs, contact Artoo.
